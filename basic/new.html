            <p>AI <a href="https://technhuman.blogspot.com/2023/03/how-artificial-intelligence-works.html">Artificial
                    Intelligence</a> works by combining large amounts of data with fast, iterative processing and
                intelligent algorithms,
                allowing the software to learn automatically from patterns or features in the data. AI is a broad field
                of study that includes many theories, methods and technologies, as well as the following major
                subfields:
                Machine learning automates analytical model building. It uses methods from neural networks, statistics,
                operations research and physics to find hidden insights in data without explicitly being programmed for
                where to look or what to conclude.
                A neural network is a type of machine learning that is made up of interconnected units (like neurons)
                that processes information by responding to external inputs, relaying information between each unit. The
                process requires multiple passes at the data to find connections and derive meaning from undefined data.
                Deep learning uses huge neural networks with many layers of processing units, taking advantage of
                advances in computing power and improved training techniques to learn complex patterns in large amounts
                of data. Common applications include image and speech recognition.
                Cognitive computing is a subfield of AI that strives for a natural, human-like interaction with
                machines. Using AI and cognitive computing, the ultimate goal is for a machine to simulate human
                processes through the ability to interpret images and speech _ and then speak coherently in response.
                Computer vision relies on pattern recognition and deep learning to recognize what's in a picture or
                video. When machines can process, analyze and understand images, they can capture images or videos in
                real time and interpret their surroundings.
                Natural language processing (NLP) is the ability of computers to analyze, understand and generate human
                language, including speech. The next stage of NLP is natural language interaction, which allows humans
                to communicate with computers using normal, everyday language to perform tasks.</p>

                    Technology</a>Green technology, also known as environmental technology or clean technology, is a
                rapidly
                growing field that focuses on developing solutions that reduce the negative impact of human activities
                on
                the environment. Green technology covers a wide range of areas, including renewable energy, sustainable
                materials, and eco-friendly devices. In recent years, there have been many exciting developments in
                green
                technology that offer hope for a more sustainable future.</p>

                Quantum computing is a type of computing that utilizes the principles of quantum mechanics to process
                information. In traditional computing, information is processed using bits, which can be either a 0 or a
                1. In quantum computing, information is processed using quantum bits, or qubits, which can be both a 0
                and a 1 at the same time. This phenomenon is known as superposition and allows quantum computers to
                perform calculations that are impossible for traditional computers.
